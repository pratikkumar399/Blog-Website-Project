    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Time has flown like a wind,</div>
    <div>since the time you met him,</div>
    <div>since the time you left him.</div>
    <div>But, he was still there&nbsp;</div>
    <div>standing, fighting, and making his way&nbsp;</div>
    <div>through a mountain of obstacles.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>From the time he was able to understand emotions and feelings&nbsp;</div>
    <div>he started craving for it ,</div>
    <div>from someone-&nbsp;</div>
    <div>who was unknown to him.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>People came into his life just like you&nbsp;</div>
    <div>and his craving for love grew more and more .</div>
    <div>But, they changed their paths,</div>
    <div>unable to understand what he truly wanted.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>And his search for love in someone else continued to grow&nbsp;</div>
    <div>He hated himself for not being able to love back the way he wanted,</div>
    <div>Soon he was left with nobody to talk to,</div>
    <div>He was in solitude with himself,</div>
    <div>full of emotions and unanswered questions.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>When, he perceived what he wanted,</div>
    <div>He got to know the feeling of self-love,</div>
    <div>His cravings came to an end,</div>
    <div>after he understood the truth that&nbsp;</div>
    <div>loved are the persons who love themselves&nbsp;</div>
    <div>loved are the persons who make something of themselves&nbsp;</div>
    <div>loved are the person who have fought back and hence become Bravehearts .</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>From the day he got his answers&nbsp;</div>
    <div>He has no longer craved for love,</div>
    <div>in someone else,</div>
    <div>because it was there with him, within him.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>There is a reason he is still standing,</div>
    <div>He never knew he would be landing ,</div>
    <div>And he will run fast,</div>
    <div>and outlast-</div>
    <div>everyone, that said NO!</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Now, you watch him and wonder:&nbsp;</div>
    <div>How can people around him, love him,</div>
    <div>when he once, was a person so desperate for your love?&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>He has a piece of advice for you-</div>
    <div>Go and love yourself and stop craving for his love.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div><br /></div>
